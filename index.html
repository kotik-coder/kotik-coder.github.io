                <h3><strong>P</strong>rocessing <strong>U</strong>nit for <strong>L</strong>aser Fla<strong>s</strong>h<strong> E</strong>xperiments</h3>

                <p align="justify"> PULsE allows effective treatment of difficult cases where conditions may not be ideal for simpler analysis. 
		PULsE analyses the heating curves from laser flash experiments and outputs the thermal properties of the sample. 
		PULsE is specifically tailored for use in the Materials Research Facility at UKAEA, and reads ASCII files 
		generated by the Linseis LFA; it was initially designed to read custom file formats from the 'Kvant' laser flash analyser (designed 
		at the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute). If you would like to contribute to extending the list of supported formats,
		please feel free to contact the author using e-mail and feel free to browse the github repository.</p> 
		<p align="justify">A <a href="LatexManual_02.pdf">manual</a> explaining the installation procedure and detailing available features of PULsE can be downloaded.</p>
		<p  align="justify">This software has been written in Java 11 and requires JavaFX and gnuplot to run properly. A <a href="./apidocs/index.html">javadoc</a> is available with information
		on what Java classes and methods it contains, including specification of data formats.</p>
		
		Main features of PULsE:
                <ul>
                    <li> Calculates the time-temperature profiles for the laser flash experiments by solving heat conduction problems with high-accuracy finite difference schemes 
                    <li> Solves the reverse heat conduction problems by using advanced numerical optimisation techniques
                    <li> Provides an easy to use, light-weight graphical user interface based on a mix of Swing, JavaFX and gnuplot
                    <li> Automatically estimates the available computing power and tries to use multi-threading for batch processing of tasks
                    <li> Plots interactive heating curves for the user to adjust the calculation domain and to check the quality of fit
		    <li> Manages results with dynamically-adjustable format; capable of auto-merging resuts and calculating standard errors on-the-fly
		    <li> Preview-plotting of results with gnuplot
		    <li> Comprehensive logging that can show both intermediate execution steps and time events
		    <li> Ability to export everything using either an html or a csv format
                </ul>
